# Iris Species Analysis â€“ Statistics & Machine Learning

## Description

A data analysis and machine learning project based on the classic **Iris dataset**, aimed at exploring the relationships between different flower features and accurately classifying Iris species. The project involves comprehensive statistical analysis, data visualization, and machine learning model building.

## Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
  Includes statistical measures such as mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, range, interquartile range (IQR), skewness, and kurtosis for each feature.
  
- **Data Visualization**:  
  Graphical insights using histograms, boxplots, pair plots, violin plots, and heatmaps to understand feature distributions and correlations.
  
- **Clustering Techniques**:  
  - **K-Means Clustering**  
  - **K-Medoids Clustering** *(with focus on implementation and evaluation)*

- **Classification Models**:  
  Implemented models like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for species prediction.

- **Model Evaluation**:  
  Metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report used to evaluate model performance.

- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab Compatible**:  
  Interactive and well-documented code cells for better understanding.

## Tech Stack

- **Python 3.x**
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas` and `numpy` *(for data analysis and manipulation)*  
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` *(for data visualization)*  
  - `scikit-learn` *(for machine learning models and evaluation)*  
  - `scipy` *(for statistical analysis)*  

## Dataset

- **Iris Dataset**:  
  Available via [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) or `sklearn.datasets`.

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Apply PCA (Principal Component Analysis) for dimensionality reduction  
- Integrate GUI using Streamlit for interactive classification  
- Write a research paper/report with insights and visualizations  
- Compare more clustering techniques like DBSCAN or Agglomerative Clustering
